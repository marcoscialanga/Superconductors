# Superconductors
The contributors for this project were: Christopher Clegg, Nora Liu, Marco Scialanga, undergraduate students at UCLA.
We predict superconductors' critical temperature with a fully connected neural network.
The dataset was taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
A full and accurate description of the project is in the file containing the code and graphs.
